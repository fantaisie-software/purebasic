# ************************************************************************

# ************************************************************************
#
# Run this script to setup a command shell with the proper environment
# variables required for building the IDE and other programs in this 
# repository.
#
# The commandline for execution of this script is the following:
#
#    ./BuildEnv.sh <TargetPureBasicDirectory>
#
# The <TargetPureBasicDirectory> parameter is mandatory. It specifies 
# the compiler to use and building the IDE will actually override 
# the IDE and other resources within that target directory. It is 
# therefore recommended to setup a dedicated PB installation for
# IDE development and testing.
#
# If the target directory is a SpiderBasic installation, the SB IDE 
# will be built instead. Note that for this case you will need a 
# regular PB installation available in the PATH as well.
#
# By default this script will launch a command shell with the build
# environment. You can suppress this by setting the PB_BATCH=1 env
# variable before running this script. Alternatively, if you source the
# script into another script, the automatic shell creation is disabled.
#
# The used operating system as well as other needed settings are detected
# automatically. The following options can be set manually for further
# customization:
#
#    PB_SUBSYSTEM=<path to subsystem folder>
#
#      Specify the subsystem subfolder for compilation of residents 
#      or import definitions. This setting is not needed to compile the 
#      IDE or debugger
