@Library Clipboard

@Overview

  The clipboard is the standard way to share information and data between applications.
  It also gives the user a temporary location
  where information and data may be stored and accessed quickly and easily. For instance,
  when text is cut within an editor, that text goes to the clipboard, where it may be
  retrieved later, by pasting it into another application.
