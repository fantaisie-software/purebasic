@Title Compiler Directives

@Syntax

  @Keyword CompilerIf <constant expression>
    ...
  [@Keyword CompilerElseIf]
    ...
  [@Keyword CompilerElse]
    ...
  @Keyword CompilerEndIf

@Description

  If the <constant expression> result is true, the code inside the @Keyword CompilerIf will be compiled, 
  else it will be totally ignored. It's useful when building multi-OSes programs to
  customize some programs part by using OS specific functions. The @Keyword And and @Keyword Or Keywords 
  can be used in <constant expression> to combine multiple conditions.

  @Example

@Code
  CompilerIf #PB_Compiler_OS = #PB_OS_Linux And #PB_Compiler_Processor = #PB_Processor_x86
    ; some Linux and x86 specific code.
  CompilerEndIf
@EndCode

  


@Syntax

  @Keyword CompilerSelect <numeric constant>
    @Keyword CompilerCase <numeric constant>
      ...
    [@Keyword CompilerDefault]
      ...
  @Keyword CompilerEndSelect

@Description

  Works like a regular @ReferenceLink "Select_EndSelect" "Select : EndSelect" except that only one numeric 
  value is allowed per case. It will tell the compiler which code should 
  be compiled. It's useful when building multi-OSes programs to customize some programs part 
  by using OS specific functions.

  @Example

@Code
  CompilerSelect #PB_Compiler_OS
    CompilerCase #PB_OS_AmigaOS
      ; some Amiga specific code
    CompilerCase #PB_OS_Linux
      ; some Linux specific code
  CompilerEndSelect
@EndCode


@Syntax

  @Keyword CompilerError <string constant>

@Description

  Generates an error, as if it was a syntax error and display the associated message. It can be useful
  when doing specialized routines, or to inform a source code is not available on an particular OS.

  @Example

@Code
  CompilerIf #PB_Compiler_OS = #PB_OS_AmigaOS
    CompilerError "AmigaOS isn't supported, sorry."
  CompilerElse
    CompilerError "OS supported, you can now comment me."
  CompilerEndIf

@EndCode



@Syntax

  @Keyword EnableExplicit
  @Keyword DisableExplicit

@Description

  Enables or disables the explicit mode. When enabled, all the @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables" which are not explicitly
  declared with @ReferenceLink "define" "Define", @ReferenceLink "global" "Global", @ReferenceLink "protected" "Protected" or
  @ReferenceLink "static" "Static" are not accepted and the compiler
  will raise an error. It can help to catch typo bugs.

  @Example

@Code
  EnableExplicit
  
  Define a
  
  a = 20 ; Ok, as declared with 'Define'
  b = 10 ; Will raise an error here
@EndCode


@Syntax

  @Keyword EnableJS
  @Keyword DisableJS

@Description

  Enables or disables the inline javascript. Inside this block, the line are left untouched and put as is
  in the generated code. See the @ReferenceLink "InlinedJS" "inline javascript" section for more information.
  
  @Example

@Code
  ; 
  ;
  Test = 10
  
  EnableJS
    v_test = 20
  DisableJS
  
  Debug Test ; Will be 20
@EndCode

@Section Reserved Constants

  The SpiderBasic compiler has several reserved constants which can be useful to the programmer: 
  
@FixedFont
  @#PB_Compiler_OS : Determines on which OS the compiler is currently running. It can be one of the following values:
    @#PB_OS_Windows : The compiler is creating Windows executable (PureBasic)
    @#PB_OS_Linux   : The compiler is creating Linux executable (PureBasic)
    @#PB_OS_AmigaOS : The compiler is creating AmigaOS executable (PureBasic)
    @#PB_OS_MacOS   : The compiler is creating OS X executable (PureBasic)
    @#PB_OS_Web     : The compiler is generating a JavaScript file (SpiderBasic)

  @#PB_Compiler_Processor : Determines the processor type for which the output is created. It can be one of the following:
    @#PB_Processor_x86     : x86 processor architecture (also called IA-32 or x86-32) (PureBasic)
    @#PB_Processor_x64     : x86-64 processor architecture (also called x64, AMD64 or Intel64) (PureBasic)
    @#PB_Processor_PowerPC : PowerPC processor architecture (PureBasic)
    @#PB_Processor_mc68000 : Motorola 68000 processor architecture (PureBasic)
    @#PB_Processor_JavaScript : JavaScript output (SpiderBasic)
    
  @#PB_Compiler_App : Determines the app type for which the output is created. It can be one of the following:
    @#PB_App_Web    : Web app
    @#PB_App_Android: Android app
    @#PB_App_IOS    : IOS app
  
  @#PB_Compiler_Date     : Current date, at the compile time, in the SpiderBasic  @LibraryLink "Date" "date" format.
  @#PB_Compiler_File     : Full path and name of the file being compiled, useful for debug purpose.
  @#PB_Compiler_FilePath : Full path of the file being compiled, useful for debug purpose.
  @#PB_Compiler_Filename : Filename (without path) of the file being compiled, useful for debug purpose.
  @#PB_Compiler_Line     : Line number of the file being compiled, useful for debug purpose.
  @#PB_Compiler_Procedure: Current procedure name, if the line is inside a @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedure".
  @#PB_Compiler_Module   : Current module name, if the line is inside a @ReferenceLink "module" "module".
  @#PB_Compiler_Version  : Compiler version, in integer format in the form '420' for 4.20.
  @#PB_Compiler_Home     : Full path of the SpiderBasic directory, can be useful to locate @ReferenceLink "includes" "include files"
  @#PB_Compiler_Debugger : Set to 1 if the runtime debugger is enabled, set to 0 else. When a final project is created
                          is created, the debugger is always disabled (this constant will be 0).
  @#PB_Compiler_InlineJavaScript : Set to 1 if the if the code is inside a EnableJS/DisableJS block.
  @#PB_Compiler_EnableExplicit: Set to 1 if the executable is compiled with enable explicit support, set to 0 else.
  @#PB_Compiler_IsMainFile    : Set to 1 if the file being compiled is the main file, set to 0 else.
  @#PB_Compiler_IsIncludeFile : Set to 1 if the file being compiled has been included by another file, set to 0 else.
  
@EndFixedFont
