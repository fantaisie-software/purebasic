@Title Debugger keywords in SpiderBasic

@Section Overview

  Following is a list of special keywords to control the debugger from your source code.
  There is also a @LibraryLink "Debugger" "Debugger library" which provides further
  functions to modify the behavior of the debugger should it be present.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak


  @Syntax
  
    @Keyword CallDebugger
    
  @Description

    This invokes the "debugger" and freezes the program immediately. This will invoke the web browser debugger.
    
  
  @Syntax

    @Keyword Debug <expression> [, DebugLevel]
    
  @Description

    Display the DebugOutput window and the result inside it. The expression can be
    any valid SpiderBasic expression, from numeric to string. An important point is
    the Debug command and its associated expression is totally ignored (not compiled)
    when the debugger is deactivated. @LineBreak
    @LineBreak
    Note: This is also true, if you're using complete command lines after Debug 
    (e.g. Debug LoadImage(1,"test.bmp")). They will not be compiled with disabled debugger! @LineBreak
    @LineBreak
    This means this command can be used to trace easily in the program without having 
    to comment all the debug commands when creating the final executable. @LineBreak
    @LineBreak
    The 'DebugLevel' is the level of priority of the debug message. All normal debug message 
    (without specifying a debug level) are automatically displayed. When a level is specified 
    then the message will be only displayed if the current DebugLevel (set with the 
    following @Keyword DebugLevel command) is equals or above this number. This allows hierarchical 
    debug mode, by displaying more and more precise information in function of the used DebugLevel. 


  @Syntax
  
    @Keyword DebugLevel <constant expression>

  @Description

    Set the current debug level for the 'Debug' message. 
    @LineBreak
    @LineBreak
    Note: The debug level is set at compile time, which means you have to put the 
    @Keyword "DebugLevel" command before any other Debug commands to be sure it affects them all. 


  @Syntax
    
    @Keyword DisableDebugger

  @Description

    This will disable the debugger checks on the source code which follow this command. 


  @Syntax
    
    @Keyword EnableDebugger
    
  @Description

    This will enable the debugger checks on the source code which follow this command 
    (if the debugger was previously disabled with @Keyword DisableDebugger). 
    @LineBreak
    @LineBreak
    Note: @Keyword EnableDebugger doesn't have an effect, if the debugger is completely 
    disabled in the IDE.
