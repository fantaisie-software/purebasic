@Title Using the built-in Tools

  The SpiderBasic IDE comes with many building tools, to make programming tasks 
  easier and increase your productivity. Many of them can be configured to be 
  either accessible from the Menu as separate windows, or to be permanently 
  displayed in the Panel on the side of the editing area.

  For information on how to configure these tools and where they are displayed, 
  see @referencelink "ide_preferences" "Configuring the IDE".


@Section Tools for the Side Panel Area

@Bold "WebView"

@Image ide_tools_webview.png

  This tool displays and internal web browser to launch the SpiderBasic programs directly in the IDE.
  When the web view is enabled, the debugger automatically connect to it and the errors are directly
  reported in the IDE, on the correct file and line.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The 'earth' button is available to open the program into the default web browser.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The 'Kill Program' button (red cross in the toolbar) can be used to reset the web view content and stop
  the SpiderBasic program.

@Bold "Procedure Browser"

@Image ide_tools_procedurelist.png

  This tool displays a list of all @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedures" and @ReferenceLink "macros" "macros" declared in the current source 
  code. By double-clicking on an entry in that list, the cursor automatically 
  jumps to that procedure. 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Macros will be marked in the list by a "+" sign before the name.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  You can also place special comment marks in your code, 
  that will be displayed in the list too. They look like this: ";- <description>". 
  The ; starts a comment, the ‘-‘ that follows it immediately defines such a mark. 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The description will be shown in the Procedure list, and clicking on it will jump 
  to the line of this mark. Such a comment mark can be distinguished from a Procedure 
  by the "> " that is displayed before it in the procedure list.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The list of procedures can be sorted, and it can display the procedure/macro arguments in the list.
  For these options, see @referencelink "ide_preferences" "Configuring the IDE".

@Bold "Variable Viewer"

@Image ide_tools_variablelist.png

  The variable viewer can display @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables",
  @ReferenceLink "dim" "Arrays", @ReferenceLink "newlist" "lists",
  @ReferenceLink "general_rules" "Constants", @ReferenceLink "structures" "Structures"
  and @ReferenceLink "interfaces" "Interfaces" defined in your source code, or
  any currently opened file. You can configure what exactly it should display in 
  the @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "preferences".
@LineBreak
  Note: The displaying of variables is somewhat limited for now. It can only detect 
  variables explicitly declared with @ReferenceLink "define" "Define",
  @ReferenceLink "global" "Global", @ReferenceLink "shared" "Shared",
  @ReferenceLink "protected" "Protected" or @ReferenceLink "static" "Static".

@Bold "Issue Browser"

@Image ide_tools_issues.png

  The issue browser tool collects comments in the source code that fit a defined format
  and lists them ordered by priority. It can be used to track which areas of the
  source code still need to be worked on. 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak  
  Each displayed issue corresponds to one comment in
  the code. A double-click on the issue shows that code line. Issues can be displayed for
  the current file, or for multiple files (all open files, or all files that belong to 
  the current @ReferenceLink "ide_projects" "project"). 
  The issue list can also be exported in CSV format.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  To configure the collected issues, see the "Issues" section in the
  @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "Preferences".

  The individual components (red/green/blue intensities or hue/saturation/lightness) as well as
  the hexadecimal representation of the current color can be seen and modified in the text fields.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The "Insert Color" button inserts the hexadecimal value of the current color in the source code.
  The "Insert RGB" button inserts the color as a call to the @@RGB or 
  @@RGBA function into the code. The "Save Color" button saves the current color
  to the history area at the bottom. Clicking on a color in the history makes it the current color again.

@Bold "Help Tool"

@Image ide_tools_help.png

  The Help Tool is an alternative viewer for the @ReferenceLink "ide_help" "reference guide". It can
  be used to view the SpiderBasic manual side by side with the code. Whether or not the F1 shortcut opens
  the manual in the tool or as a separate window can be specified in the 
  @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "preferences".

@Bold "File Viewer"

@Image ide_tools_fileviewer.png

  The internal file viewer allows you do display certain types of files. Text files, 
  images and web pages (windows only). Any unknown file type will be displayed in a 
  hex-viewer. The "Open" button opens a new file, the "X button" closes it and the 
  arrows can be used to navigate through the open files.
@LineBreak
  Also any binary file that you attempt to open from the Explorer tool, or by 
  double-clicking on an @ReferenceLink "includes" "IncludeBinary" keyword will be 
  displayed in this file viewer.

@Bold "Compare Files/Folders"

@Image ide_tools_diff_options.png

  This tool can compare two (text-) files or two directories and highlight their differences.
  The "Options" tab can be used to ignore some differences such as spaces or upper/lowercase changes.

@Image ide_tools_diff_files.png

  The files are shown side by side with the differences marked in the following way:
  Lines shown in red were removed in the file on the right, lines shown in green were added
  in the file on the right and lines shown in yellow were changed between the two files.

@Image ide_tools_diff_directories.png
  
  When comparing directories, the content of both directories is examined (with the option to filter
  the search by file extension and include subdirectories) and the files are marked in a similar way:
  Files in red do not exist in the second directory, files in green are new in the second directory and
  files in yellow were modified. A double-click on a modified file shows the modifications made
  to that file.
