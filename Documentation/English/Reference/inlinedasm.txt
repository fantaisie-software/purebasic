@Title Inline x86 ASM

@Section Introduction

  With the compiler using the ASM backend, PureBasic allows you to include any x86 assembler commands (including MMX and FPU one) directly 
  in the source code, as if it was a real assembler (X86 and X64 processors only). And it gives you even more: you can use directly 
  any @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables" or @ReferenceLink "memory" "pointers" in the assembler keywords, you can put any ASM commands on the same line, ... 
  
  On Windows and Linux, PureBasic uses @Bold "fasm" (@InternetLink "http://flatassembler.net/" "http://flatassembler.net"), so if you want more information about 
  the syntax, just read the @Bold "fasm" guide. @LineBreak
  On OS X, PureBasic uses @Bold "yasm" (@InternetLink "http://yasm.tortall.net/" "http://yasm.tortall.net/"), so if you want more information about 
  the syntax, just read the @Bold "yasm" guide. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  To activate the inline assembler use the compiler directives @ReferenceLink "CompilerDirectives" "EnableASM" and @ReferenceLink "CompilerDirectives" "DisableASM". @LineBreak
  It's possible to enable the ASM syntax coloring in the IDE with the "enable inline ASM syntax coloring" @ReferenceLink "ide_compiler" "compiler option". @LineBreak
  
@Section Rules

  You have several rules to closely follow if you want to include ASM in a BASIC code : @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  - The used @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables" or @ReferenceLink "memory" "pointers" must be declared @Bold before to use them in an assembler keyword.
  Their names in assembler are 'v_variablename' and 'p_pointername', and in a @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedure" their names are 
  'p.v_variablename' and 'p.p_pointername'. @LineBreak
  - Labels: The labels need to be referenced in lowercase when using the in-line ASM. 
  When you reference a @ReferenceLink "general_rules" "label", you must put the prefix 'l_' before the name. @LineBreak 
  If the label is defined in a @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedure", then its prefix is 'll_procedurename_', in lowercase. @LineBreak
  When you reference a @ReferenceLink "module" "module" item, you must put the prefix 'module_name.l_' all in lowercase before the item.@LineBreak
  If the label is defined in a @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedure" inside a module, then its prefix is 'module_name.ll_procedurename_', in lowercase. @LineBreak

  @Example

@Code
  DeclareModule MyModule
    LabelDeclareModule: ;Its name is mymodule.l_labeldeclaremodule:
    Declare Init()
  EndDeclareModule

  Module MyModule
    Procedure Init() 
      LabelModuleProcedure: ; Its name is mymodule.ll_init_labelmoduleprocedure: 
      Debug "InitFerrari()"  
    EndProcedure
  
    LabelModule1: ;Its name is mymodule.l_labelmodule1:
  EndModule

  Procedure Test (*Pointer, Variable)
    TokiSTART:  ;Its name is ll_test_tokistart:
  
    ! MOV dword [p.p_Pointer], 20
    ! MOV dword [p.v_Variable], 30
    Debug *Pointer  ;Its name is p.p_Pointer
    Debug Variable  ;Its name is p.v_Variable
  EndProcedure
  
  VAR=1                       ;Its name is v_VAR
  *Pointt=AllocateMemory(10)  ;Its name is p_Pointt
  
  MyModule::Init()
  Test(0,0)

  Label1: ;Its name is l_label1:
  
  !jmp l_labelend ; An instruction in assembler has to use the rules above. Here it's l_namelabel
  ;...
  LabelEnd: ;Its name is l_labelend:
@EndCode 

  - The errors in an ASM part are not reported by PureBasic but by FASM. Just check your code if a such error happen. @LineBreak
  - With enabled InlineASM you can't use ASM keywords as label names in your source. @LineBreak
  - On x86 processors, the available volatile registers are: eax, ecx and edx, xmm0, xmm1, xmm2 and xmm3. All others must be always preserved. @LineBreak
  - On x64 processors, the available volatile registers are: rax, rcx, rdx, r8, r9, xmm0, xmm1, xmm2 and xmm3. All others must be always preserved. @LineBreak
  - Windows only: an ASM help-file could be downloaded @InternetLink "http://www.purebasic.com/download/AsmHelp.zip" here. If you place the 'ASM.HLP' in the 'Help/' folder of PureBasic, 
    you can also get help on ASM keywords with F1. (Note: this feature is only enabled, when InlineASM is enabled). @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  When using assembler in a @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedure", you have to be aware of several important things:  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  - To return directly the 'eax' (or 'rax' on x64) register content, just use @Keyword "ProcedureReturn", without any expression. 
    It will let the 'eax' (or 'rax' on x64) register content untouched and use it as return-value.

  @Example

@Code
  Procedure.l MyTest()
    MOV eax, 45
    ProcedureReturn  ; The returned value will be 45
  EndProcedure
@EndCode  

  - Local variables in PureBasic are directly indexed by the stack pointer, which means if 
    the stack pointer change via an ASM instruction (like PUSH, POP etc..) the variable index will 
    be wrong and direct variable reference won't work anymore. 
    @LineBreak
    @LineBreak
  - It's possible to pass directly an assembly line to the assembler without being processed by the compiler
    by using the '!' character at the line start. This allow to have a full access to the assembler directives.
    When using this, it's possible to reference the local variables using the notation 
    'p.v_variablename' for a regular variable or 'p.p_variablename' for a pointer.
    
   @Example

@Code
  Procedure Test(*Pointer, Variable)
    ! MOV dword [p.p_Pointer], 20
    ! MOV dword [p.v_Variable], 30
    Debug *Pointer
    Debug Variable
  EndProcedure
  
  Test(0, 0)
@EndCode
