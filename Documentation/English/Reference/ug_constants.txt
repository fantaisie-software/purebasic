@Title UserGuide - Constants

In addition to @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables" PureBasic provides a method to
define @ReferenceLink "general_rules" "constants" too. In fact it provides several.
We’ll have a quick look at them now.

Predefined constants - provided either by PureBasic itself (all begin with #PB_), or
from the API for the operating system. The IDE’s @ReferenceLink "ide_tools" "Structure Viewer"
tool has a panel which shows all the predefined constants.

User defined constants - by defining a constant name with the prefix # you can provide
your own constants to make code more readable.
@Code
  #MyConstant1 = 10
  #MyConstant2 = "Hello, World!"
@EndCode

@ReferenceLink "enumerations" "Enumerations" – PureBasic will automatically number a
series of constants sequentially in an Enumeration, by default enumerations will
begin from zero – but this can be altered, if desired.

@Code
  Enumeration
    #MyConstantA
    #MyConstantB
    #MyConstantC
  EndEnumeration
  
  Enumeration 10 Step 5
    #MyConstantD
    #MyConstantE
    #MyConstantF
  EndEnumeration
  
  Debug #MyConstantA   ; will be 0
  Debug #MyConstantB   ; will be 1
  Debug #MyConstantC   ; will be 2
  
  Debug #MyConstantD   ; will be 10
  Debug #MyConstantE   ; will be 15
  Debug #MyConstantF   ; will be 20
@EndCode
