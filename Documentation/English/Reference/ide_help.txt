@Title Getting Help

  The PureBasic IDE provides ways to access the PureBasic help-file, as well as other files
  and documentation you want to view while programming.

@Section Quick access to the reference guide

@Image ide_help_purebasic.png

  By pressing the help shortcut (F1 by default) or selecting the "Help..." command from the Help
  menu while the mouse cursor is over a PureBasic keyword or function, the help will be opened
  directly at the description of that keyword or function.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  If the word at the cursor position has no help entry, the main reference page will be displayed.

  The reference manual can also be viewed side by side with the source code using the
  @ReferenceLink "ide_tools" "Help Tool".

@Section Quick access to Windows API help

  There are two ways to get the same quick access as for the PureBasic functions (by pressing F1 with the
  cursor on the function) also for functions of the Windows API. To enable this feature you have to download
  additional help files for these functions:

@Bold "Microsoft Platform SDK"

; @Image ide_help_psdk.png

  The Microsoft Platform SDK provides the most complete and up to date programming reference available for 
  the windows platform. It provides information on all API functions, as well as overviews and introductions
  to the different technologies used when programming for the windows platform.
  It is however quite big (up to 400MB depending on the selected components). 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  For the IDE help, you can either install the "February 2003" or the "Windows Server 2003 SP1" edition of the SDK.

  It can be downloaded from here:

  @InternetLink "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15656" "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15656"
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Note that the SDK can also be ordered on CD from this page. Also if you are the owner of any development products
  from Microsoft (such as Visual Studio), there might be a copy of the SDK included on one of the CDs that came with it.

@Bold "The win32.hlp help-file"

; @Image ide_help_winapi.png

  There is a much smaller alternative to the complete SDK by Microsoft (7.5 MB download). This help is quite old
  (written for Windows95 in fact), so it does not provide any information on new APIs and technologies introduced
  since then. 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  However, it provides good information about commonly used API that is still valid today, as these
  mostly did not change. This download is recommended if you only need occasional help for API functions, but do not
  want to download the full SDK.

  It can be downloaded from here:

  @InternetLink "http://www.purebasic.com/download/WindowsHelp.zip" "http://www.purebasic.com/download/WindowsHelp.zip"
@LineBreak

  To use it from the PureBasic IDE, just create a "Help" subdirectory in your PureBasic folder and copy the "win32.hlp" file 
  into it.

@Section Accessing external helpfiles from the IDE

  If you have other helpfiles you wish to be able to access from the IDE, then create a "Help" subdirectory in your PureBasic
  folder and copy them to it. These files will appear in the "External Help" submenu of the Help menu, and in the
  popupmenu you get when right-clicking in the editing area.

@OS Windows
  Chm and Hlp files will be displayed in the MS help viewer.
@EndOS

  The IDE will open the helpfiles in the internal fileviewer. So files like text files can be viewed directly like this.
  For other types, you can use the @referencelink ide_externaltools "Config Tools" menu to configure an external tool to
  handle the type of help-file you use. The help will then be displayed in that tool.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  For example, if you have pdf helpfiles, configure an external tool to handle pdf files and put the files in the Help
  subdirectory of PureBasic. Now if you click the file in the "external help" menu, it will be opened in that external tool.
