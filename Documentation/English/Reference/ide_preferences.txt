@Title Customizing the IDE

  The PureBasic IDE provides many options to customize or disable some of its 
  features in order to become the perfect tool for you. 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  These options are accessible from the Preferences command in the File menu, and the 
  meaning of each setting is described here.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Any changes made will only take effect once you click the "OK" button or "Apply".

@Section General

@Image ide_prefs_general.png

  Options that affect the general behavior of the IDE.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Run only one Instance"
@LineBreak
  If set, prevents the IDE from being opened more than once. Clicking on a 
  PB file in the explorer will open it in the already existing IDE instance 
  instead of opening a new one.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Disable Splash screen"
@LineBreak
  Disables the splash screen that is displayed on start-up.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Memorize Window positions"
@LineBreak
  Remembers the position of all IDE windows when you close them. If you prefer to 
  have all windows open at a specific location and size, enable this option, move 
  all windows to the perfect position, then restart the IDE (to save all options) 
  and then disable this option to always open all windows in the last saved position.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Show window contents while moving the Splitter"
@LineBreak
  Enable this only if you have a fast computer. Otherwise moving the Splitter 
  bar to the Error Log or Tools Panel may flicker a lot.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Auto-Reload last open sources"
@LineBreak
  On IDE start-up, opens all the sources that were open when the IDE was closed the last time.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Display full Source Path in Title bar"
@LineBreak
  If set, the IDE title bar will show the full path to the currently 
  edited file. If not, only the filename is shown.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Recent Files list"
@LineBreak
  This setting specifies how many entries are shown in the "Recent Files" 
  submenu of the File menu.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Search History size"
@LineBreak
  This setting specifies how many recent search words are 
  remembered for "Find/Replace" and "Find in Files"
  
@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Check for updates"
@LineBreak
  Specifies how often the IDE should check on the purebasic.com server for the
  availability of new updates. An update check can also be performed manually at any time 
  from the "Help" menu.
  
@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Check for releases"
@LineBreak
  Specifies which kind of releases should cause a notification if they are available.

; General - Language
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Section General - Language

@Image ide_prefs_language.png

  This allows you to change the language of the IDE. The combo box shows the 
  available languages, and you can view some information about the language file
  (for example who translated it and when it was last updated).

; == LINUX ONLY ==
@OS Linux
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Note: Changing the language for the IDE might require you to change the default 
  font for Gtk, in order to display all strings correctly. See the configuration tools 
  of your Linux distribution on how to change that.
@formatendif

@Image ide_prefs_themes.png

  This section shows the available icon themes for the IDE and allows to select
  the theme to use. The IDE comes with two themes by default. 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  More themes can be easily added by creating a zip-file containing the images 
  (in png format) and a "Theme.prefs" file to describe the theme. The zip-file
  has to be copied to the "Themes" folder in the PureBasic installation directory
  to be recognized by the IDE. The "SilkTheme.zip" file can be used as an example 
  to create a new theme.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Display Icons in the Menu"
@LineBreak
  Allows to hide/show the images in the IDE menus.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Show main Toolbar"

@Bold "IDE Icon" : allows you to select one of the IDE's own icons in the combo box on the right.
@LineBreak
@Bold "Icon File" : allows you to specify your own icon file to use in the edit box on the right
  (PNG files are supported on all platforms, Windows additionally supports icon files).

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  If you do not select a separator or space, you can specify an action to carry out when the button is pressed:
@LineBreak

@Bold "Menu Item" : carries out the menu command specified in the combo box on the right.
@LineBreak
@Bold "Run tool" : executes the external tool specified in the combo box on the right.

@LineBreak
  If set, the tab key inserts a real tab character instead of spaces. 
  If not set, there are spaces inserted when Tab is pressed. 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Note that if real tab is used, the "Tab Length" option specifies 
  the size of one displayed tab character.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Source Directory"
@LineBreak
  Specifies the default directory used in the Open and Save dialogs 
  if no other files are currently open (if another file is open, its 
  path will be used as default).
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Set this to the path were you usually save the source codes.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Code file extensions"
@LineBreak
  The IDE detects code files by their extension (pb, pbi or pbf by default). Non-code files
  are edited in a "plain text" mode in which code-related features are disabled.

; Editor - Coloring
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Section Editor - Coloring

@Image ide_prefs_editorcolors.png

  Here you can change the color settings for the syntax coloring, as well as 
  the debugger marks. Default color schemes can be selected from the box on the 
  bottom, and also modified after they have been set.
  Individual color settings can be disabled by use of the checkboxes.

@Os Windows

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
   
  Note: The 'Accessibility' color scheme has (apart from high-contrast colors) a special setting
  to always use the system color for the selection in the code editor. This helps screen-reader 
  applications to better detect the selected text.

@EndOs

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Editor - Coloring - Custom Keywords
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Section Editor - Coloring - Custom Keywords

@Image ide_prefs_ownkeywords.png

  In this section, a list of custom keywords can be defined. These keywords can have a special color
  assigned to them in the coloring options and the IDE will apply case-correction to them if this feature is enabled.
  This allows for applying a special color to special keywords by preprocessor tools or macro sets,
  or to simply have some PB keywords colored differently.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Note that these keywords take precedence above all other coloring in the IDE, so this allows to
  change the color or case correction even for PureBasic keywords.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The keywords can be either entered directly in the preferences or specified in a text file with
  one keyword per line (or both).


;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Editor - Folding
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Section Editor - Folding

@Image ide_prefs_editorfolding.png

  Here you can set the keywords in the source code that start/end a foldable 
  section of code. You can add any number of words that will mark such a sections. 
  You can also choose to completely disable the folding feature.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Words that are found inside comments are ignored, unless the defined keyword includes 
  the comment symbol at the start (like the default ";{" keyword).
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  A keyword may not include spaces.


;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Editor - Indentation
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Image ide_prefs_indent.png

  Here you can specify how the editor handles code indentation when the return key is pressed.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak


@Bold "No indentation"
@LineBreak
  Pressing return always places the cursor at the beginning of the next line.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Block mode"
@LineBreak
  The newly created line gets the same indentation as the one before it.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Keyword sensitive"
@LineBreak
  Pressing the return key corrects the indentation of both the old line and the new line depending
  on the @ReferenceLink "general_rules" "keywords" on these lines. The rules for this are specified in the keyword list below. These
  rules also apply when the "Reformat indentation" item in the @ReferenceLink "ide_editing" "edit menu" is used.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Show indentation guides"
@LineBreak
  Causes vertical lines to be shown to visualize the indentation on each line. This makes it easier
  to see which source lines are on the same level of indentation.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak


@Bold "Show whitespace characters"
@LineBreak
  Causes whitespace characters to be visible as little dots (spaces) or arrows (tab characters).

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The keyword list contains the keywords that have an effect on the indentation. The "Before" setting specifies
  the change in indentation on the line that contains the keyword itself while the "After" setting specifies the
  change that applies to the line after it.

@Bold "Box width / Box height"
@LineBreak
  Here you can define the size of the auto complete list (in pixel).
  Note that these are maximum values. The displayed box may become smaller if there are only a few items to display.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Add opening Brackets to Functions/Arrays/Lists"
@LineBreak
  Will automatically add a "(" after any function/Array/List inserted by auto 
  complete. Functions with no parameters or lists get a "()" added.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Add a Space after PB Keywords followed by an expression"
@LineBreak
  When inserting PB keywords that cannot appear alone, a space 
  is automatically added after them.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Add matching ‘End' keyword if Tab/Enter is pressed twice"
@LineBreak
  If you press Tab or Enter twice, it will insert the corresponding end 
  keyword (for example "EndSelect" to "Select" or "EndIf " to "If") to 
  the keyword you have just inserted. The end keyword will be inserted 
  after the cursor, so you can continue typing after the first keyword 
  that was inserted.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Automatically popup AutoComplete for Structure items"
@LineBreak
  Displays the list automatically whenever a structured variable or interface is entered
  and the "\" character is typed after it to show the list of possible structure

  Source code items are added from all currently open source codes.

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Editor - Issues
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Section Editor - Issues

@Image ide_prefs_issues.png

  Allows to configure the collection of 'issue' markers from comments in the source code.
  Issue markers can be displayed in the @ReferenceLink "ide_tools" "Issues" or ProcedureBrowser
  tool, and they can be marked within the source code with a separate background color.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  A definition for an issue consists of the following:
  
@Indent

  @Underline "Issue name"
  @LineBreak
    A name for the type of issue.
  
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  
  @Underline "Regular expression"
  @LineBreak
    A regular expression defining the pattern for the issue. This regular expression
    is applied to all comments in the source code. Each match of the expression is
    considered to match the issue type.
  
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  
  @Underline "Priority"
  @LineBreak
    Each issue type is assigned a priority. The priority can be used to order and filter
    the displayed issues in the issue tool.
  
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak

  @Underline "Color"
  @LineBreak
    The color used to mark the issue in the source code (if enabled). The color will be used
    to mark the background of either only the issue text itself, or the entire code line depending
    on the coloring option.
  
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak  
  
  @Underline "Show in issue tool"
  @LineBreak
    If enabled, any found issues of this type are listed in the issues tool. This option
    can be disabled to cause an issue to only be marked in the source code with a special
    background color if desired.
  
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak 
  
  @Underline "Show in procedure browser"
  @LineBreak
    If enabled, any found issues are shown as an entry in the procedure browser tool.

; Editor - Session history
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Section Editor - Session history

@Image ide_prefs_sessionhistory.png

  Allows to configure how the session history is recording changes.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Enable recording of history"
@LineBreak
  Enable or disable the history session recording. When enabled, all the changes made to a file will be recorded
  in the background in a database. A session is created when the IDE launch, and is closed when the IDE quits.
  This is useful to rollback to a previous version of a file, or to find back a deleted 
  or corrupted file. It's like a very powerful source backup tool, limited in time (by default one month
  of recording). It's not aimed to replace a real source versioning system like SVN or GIT. It's complementary
  to have finer change trace. The source code will be stored without encryption, so if you are working on
  sensitive source code, be sure to have this database file in a secure location, or disable this feature.
  It's possible to define the session history database location using an @ReferenceLink "ide_commandline" "IDE command-line" switch.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Record change every X minutes"
@LineBreak
  Change the interval between each silent recording (when editing). A file will be automatically recorded when
  saving or closing it.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Record only changes to files smaller than X kilobytes"
@LineBreak
  Change the maximum size (in kilobytes) of the files being recorded. This allow to exclude very big files which
  could make the database grow a lot.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Keep all history"
@LineBreak
  Keep all the history, the database is never purged. It will always grows, so it should be watched.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Keep maximum X sessions"
@LineBreak
  After reaching the maximum number of sessions, the oldest session will be removed from the database.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Keep sessions for X days"
@LineBreak
  After reaching the maximum number of days, the session will be removed from the database.

; Compiler
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Section Compiler

@Image ide_prefs_compiler.png

  This page allows to select additional compilers which should be available for compilation
  in the @ReferenceLink "ide_compiler" "Compiler Options". This allows switching between different
  compilers of the same version (like the x86 and x64 compilers) or even switching between different 
  versions easily.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Any PureBasic compiler starting from Version 4.10 can be added here. The target processor of the
  selected compilers does not have to match that of the default compiler, as long as the target
  operating system is the same. The list displays the compiler version and path of the selected
  compilers.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The information used by the IDE (for code highlighting, auto complete, structure viewer) always 
  comes from the default compiler. The additional compilers are only used for compilation.

@LineBreak
  Select the type of debugger you want to use when compiling from the IDE here.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Choose Warning level"
@LineBreak
  Select the action that should be taken if the debugger issues a warning.
  The available options are:
@LineBreak
  @Underline "Ignore Warnings:" Warnings will be ignored without displaying anything.
@LineBreak
  @Underline "Display Warnings:" Warnings will be displayed in the error log and the source 
  code line will be marked, but the program continues to run.
@LineBreak
  @Underline "Treat Warnings as Errors:" A warning will be treated like an error.
@LineBreak
  See @ReferenceLink "ide_debugger" "Using the debugger" for more information on debugger warnings and errors.

@LineBreak
  All debugger windows will be kept on top of all other windows, 
  even from other applications.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Bring Debugger windows to front when one is focused"
@LineBreak
  With this option set, focusing one window that belongs to the 
  debugger of a file, all windows that belong to the same debugging

@LineBreak
  Includes the time of the event in the error log.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Stop execution at program start"
@LineBreak
  Each program will be started in an already halted mode, giving 
  you the opportunity to start moving step-by-step, right from 
  the start of the program.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Stop execution before program end"
@LineBreak
  Stops the program execution right before the executable would 
  unload. This gives you a last chance to use the debugging tools 
  to examine Variables or Memory before the program ends.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Kill Program after an Error"
@LineBreak
  If a program encounters an error, it will be directly ended and all 
  debugger windows closed. This gives the opportunity to directly modify 
  the code again without an explicit "Kill Program", but there is no chance 
  to examine the program after an error.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Keep Error marks after program end"
@LineBreak
  Does not remove the lines marked with errors when the program ends. This gives 
  the opportunity to still see where an error occurred while editing the code again. 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The marks can be manually removed with the "Clear error marks" command in the "Error log" 
  submenu of the debugger menu.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Clear error log on each run"
@LineBreak
  Clears the log window when you execute a program. This ensures that the log does not 
  grow too big (this option is also available with the command-line debugger selected).

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Timeout for Debugger startup"
@LineBreak
  Specifies the time in milliseconds how long the debugger will wait for a program to 
  start up before giving up. This timeout prevents the debugger from locking up 
  indefinitely if the executable cannot start for some reason.
