  @Keyword EndIf 
  
@Description

  The @Keyword If structure is used to achieve tests, and/or change the programmes direction, depending on whether the test is true or false. 
  @Keyword ElseIf optional command is used for any number of additional tests if the previous test was not true. 
  The @Keyword Else optional command is used to execute a part of code, if all previous tests were false. 
  Any number of @Keyword If structures may be nested together. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  Short-circuit evaluations for expressions are supported, meaning if a test is true, all following tests will be ignored and not even run.

  @Example Basic test

@Code
  a = 5
  If a = 10 
    Debug "a = 10"
  Else
    Debug "a <> 10"
  EndIf    
@EndCode

  @Example Multiple test

@Code
  b = 15
  If a = 10 And b >= 10 Or c = 20     
    If b = 15
      Debug "b = 15"
    Else       
      Debug "Other possibility"
    EndIf   
  Else     
    Debug "Test failure"
  EndIf  
@EndCode

  @Example Short-circuit test

@Code
  Procedure DisplayHello()
    Debug "Hello"
    ProcedureReturn 1
  EndProcedure

  a = 10
  If a = 10 Or DisplayHello() = 1 ; a is equal to 10, so the second test is fully ignored
    Debug "Test success"
  Else     
    Debug "Test failure"
  EndIf  
@EndCode
