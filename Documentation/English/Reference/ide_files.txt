@Title Working with source files

  The file menu allows you to do basic file operations like opening 
  and saving source codes. 
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  You can edit multiple source code files at the same 
  time. You can switch between them using the panel located under 
  the Toolbar. Also the shortcut keys Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab can 
  be used to jump to the next or previous open source file, respectively.

  The IDE allows the editing of non-sourcecode text files. In this "plain text" mode, code-related
  features such as coloring, case correction, auto complete are disabled. When saving plain text
  files, the IDE will not append its settings to the end of the file, even if this is configured
  for code files in the @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "Preferences".
  Whether or not a file is considered a code-file or not depends on the file extension. The standard
  PureBasic file extensions (pb, pbi and pbf) are recognized as code files. More file extensions
  can be recognized as code files by configuring their extension in the "Editor" section of the
  @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "Preferences".

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Save As..."
@LineBreak

@Bold "File format"
@LineBreak
  In this submenu you can select the text encoding as well as the newline format which should be used when the currently
  active source code is saved to disk. The IDE can handle files in Ascii or UTF-8. The newline formats it can handle are
  Windows (CRLF), Linux/Unix (LF) and MacOSX (CR). The defaults for newly created source codes can be set in the
  @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "preferences".

  description of that see @referencelink ide_preferences "Customizing the IDE".

@Bold "Session history"
@LineBreak
  Session history is a powerful tool which regularly records changes made to any files in a database. 
  A session is created when the IDE launch, and is closed when the IDE quits.
  This is useful to rollback to a previous version of a file, or to find back a deleted 
  or corrupted file. It's like source backup tool, limited in time (by default one month
  of recording). It's not aimed to replace a real source code version control system like SVN or GIT. It's complementary
  to have finer change trace. The source code will be stored without encryption, so if you are working on
  sensitive source code, be sure to have this database file in a secure location, or disable this feature.
  To configure the session history tool, see @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "preferences".
