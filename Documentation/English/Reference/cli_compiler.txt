@Title Using the command line compiler

@Section Introduction

  The command line compiler is located in the subdirectory 'compilers' from the PureBasic folder. 
  The easier way to access it is to add this directory in the PATH variable, 
  which will give access to all the commands of this directory at all times. 
  @LineBreak
@LineBreak
  There is two compilers for PureBasic: @LineBreak
  - 'pbcompiler' which is generating assembly code (x86 and x64)@LineBreak
  - 'pbcompilerc' (or 'pbcompiler' on platform which doesn't support the assembly backend) which is generating C code@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The C backend compiler is available on all supported platforms, while the ASM backend compiler
  is only supported on Windows (x86, x64), Linux (x86, x64) and OS X (x64).
  
@Section Cross-platform command switches

  Note: All switches name which begin with '/' are only valid on Windows (ie: '/DEBUGGER'). If you need to write cross-plaform
  commandline, you can use the '-' or '--' format (ie: '-d' or '--debugger).
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -h, --help, /?: displays a quick help about the compiler. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -d, --debugger, /DEBUGGER: enables the debugger support. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -pf, --purifier, /PURIFIER: enables the purifier. The debugger needs to be activated to have any effect. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -o, --output, /OUTPUT "filename": creates a standalone executable or DLL specified by the filename at the desired path location. 
  On MacOS X it's possible to create an application bundle by adding '.app' to the name of the executable. This way the whole
  directory structure will be automatically created. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -r, --resident, /RESIDENT "filename": creates a resident file specified by the filename. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -i, --import, /IMPORT "filename": creates an import file to the given filename. Only one Import/EndImport block is allowed
  in the file. The imported functions will be loaded automatically for every PureBasic projects.
@LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -l or --linenumbering, /LINENUMBERING: adds lines and files information to the executable, which can slow it considerably. 
  This allows the @LibraryLink "OnError" "OnError library" to report the file and line-number of an error. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -q, --quiet, /QUIET: disables all unnecessary text output, very useful when using another editor. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -sb, --standby, /STANDBY: loads the compiler in memory and wait for external commands (editor, scripts...). 
  More information about using this flag is available in the file 'CompilerInterface.txt' from the PureBasic 'SDK' directory. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -ir, --ignoreresident, /IGNORERESIDENT "filename": doesn't load the specified resident file when the compiler starts. It's
  mostly useful when updating a resident which already exists, so it won't load it. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -co, --constant, /CONSTANT name=value: creates the specified constant with the given expression. 
  Example: 'pbcompiler test.pb /CONSTANT MyConstant=10'. The constant @#MyConstant
  will be created on the fly with a value of 10 before the program gets compiled. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -t, --thread, /THREAD: uses thread safe runtime for strings and general routines.@LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -s, --subsystem, /SUBSYSTEM "name": uses the specific subsystem to replace a set of internal functions. For
  more information, see @ReferenceLink "subsystems" "subsystems". @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -k, --check, /CHECK: checks the syntax only, doesn't create or launch the executable. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak 
  -z, --optimizer, /OPTIMIZER: enable the code optimizer. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -c, --commented, /COMMENTED: creates a commented 'purebasic.asm' or 'purebasic.c' output file when creating an executable. 
  This file can be re-assembled with the '--reasm' option later when the needed modifications have been made. 
  This option is for advanced programmers only. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -ra, --reasm, /REASM: re-assembles the 'purebasic.asm' or 'purebasic.c' file into an executable. This allow to use the '--commented' option, 
  modify the generated output and creates the executable again. @LineBreak
  This option is for advanced programmers only. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak  
  -pp, --preprocess, /PREPROCESS "filename": preprocess the source code and write the output in the specified "Filename". 
  The processed file is a single file with all macro expanded, compiler directive handled and
  multiline resolved. This allows an easier parsing of a PureBasic source file, as all is expanded
  and is available in a flat file format. No comments are included by default, but the flag '--commented' can be
  used to have all untouched original source as comments and allow comments processing. The preprocessed
  file can be recompiled as any other PureBasic source file to create the final executable. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -g, --language, /LANGUAGE \"language\": uses the specified language for the compiler error messages. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -v, --version, /VERSION: displays the compiler version. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  @Bold "Examples:"
  
@FixedFont
  CLI> pbcompiler sourcecode.pb
@EndFixedFont
  
  The compiler will compile the source code and execute it. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  
@FixedFont
  CLI> pbcompiler sourcecode.pb --debugger
@EndFixedFont
  
  The compiler will compile the source code and execute it with debugger.
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak

@Section Windows specific command switches

  /ICON "IconName.ico" : add the specified icon to the executable. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /CONSOLE: output file in @LibraryLink "console" "Console" format. Default format is Win32. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /DLL: output file is a @ReferenceLink "dll" "DLL". @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /XP: Add the Windows XP theme support to the executable. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /MMX, /3DNOW, /SSE or /SSE2: Creates a processor specific executable. This means if a 
  processor specific routine is available it will be used for this executable. 
  Therefore, the executable will run correctly only on computer with this kind of CPU. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /DYNAMICCPU: Creates a executable containing all the available processor specific routines. 
  When the program is started, it looks for the processor type and then select the more 
  appropriates routines to use. This makes a bigger executable, but result in the 
  fastest possible program.@LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /RESOURCE "Filename": Add a Windows resource file (.rc) to the created executable or DLL. This
  should be not a compiled resource file, but an ascii file with the directives in it. It's possible
  to specify only one resource, but this file can include other resource script if needed. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /LINKER "ResponseFile": Specify a file which contains commands to be passed directly to the linker.
  On Windows, PureBasic use the PellesC linker (polink), more information about the possible
  options can be found in the related documentation. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  The following two compiler options are needed for creating programs running on Microsoft Vista OS or above (Windows 7/8/10).
  They are both options for the included manifest, so they are ignored on older windows versions. 
  With none of these switches, the exe will run as a normal user as well, but with virtualization 
  turned on (i.e. registry and file redirection). It is recommended to use the /USER switch to turn 
  of virtualization for all programs that comply to the standard user privileges, as it is only 
  intended for compatibility for older programs. These options are also available in the 
  @ReferenceLink "ide_compiler" "IDE compiler options". @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /ADMINISTRATOR: Will cause the program to request admin privileges at start. The program 
  will not run without it. This option is needed. Note: You can also @ReferenceLink "ide_debugger" "debug" 
  programs with this flag, but only with the standalone gui debugger (as it must run in elevated mode as well). @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /USER: The program will run as the user who started it. Virtualization for the exe is turned off. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /DPIAWARE: Enable DPI support to the executable. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  /DLLPROTECTION: Enable DLL preloading protection to the executable. It prevents that system DLLs are first searched for in the program directory
  instead of in the System32 directory of the Windows operating system. This option is not XP compatiable. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  
  @Bold "Examples:"
  
@FixedFont
  CLI> pbcompiler "C:\Project\Source\DLLSource.pb" /EXE "C:\Project\project.dll" /DLL
@EndFixedFont
  
  The compiler will compile the source code (here with full path) and create the DLL "project.dll" in the given directory.
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  
@Section Linux specific command switches

  -so or --sharedobject "filename": Create a dynamic library (shared object). @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -mmx, -3dnow, -sse or -sse2: Creates a processor specific executable. This means if a 
  processor specific routine is available it will be used for this executable. 
  Therefore, the executable will run correctly only on computer with this kind of CPU. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -dc or --dynamiccpu: Creates a executable containing all the available processor specific routines. 
  When the program is started, it looks for the processor type and then select the more 
  appropriates routines to use. This makes a bigger executable, but result in the 
  fastest possible program.
  
  @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  
@Section OS X specific command switches

  -n or --icon "filename.icns" : add the specified icon to the executable. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -dl or --dylib "filename": Create a dynamic library (dylib object). @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -f or --front: put the launched process to front. @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  -ibp or --ignorebundlepath: don't use the bundle path as current directory.
