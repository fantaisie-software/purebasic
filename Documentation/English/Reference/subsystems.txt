@Title Subsystems

@Section Introduction
  PureBasic integrated commandset relies on available OS libraries. Sometimes, there is different way to achieve
  the same goal and when it makes sense, PureBasic offers the possibility to change the used underlying libraries for
  specific commands, without changing one line of source code. For example, on Windows there is the 'DirectX11' subsystem
  available, which will use DirectX functions to render sprites, instead of OpenGL (which is the default subsystem).
  It can be useful to use DirectX instead of OpenGL when wanting a bit quicker rendering on Windows. @LineBreak

  To enable a subsystem, its name has to be set in the IDE @ReferenceLink "ide_compiler" "compiler options", or through the /SUBSYSTEM @ReferenceLink "cli_compiler" "command-line" switch.
  This is a compile time option, which means an executable can not embed more than one subsystem at once. If multiple support is
  needed (for example shipping an OpenGL and DirectX version of a game), two executables needs to be created. @LineBreak

  The available subsystems are located in the PureBasic 'subsystems' folder. Any residents or libraries found in this drawer
  will have precedency over the default libraries and residents, when a subsystem is specified. Any number of different subsystems
  can be specified (as long it doesn't affect the same libraries). @LineBreak
  @LineBreak
  The @Keyword Subsystem @ReferenceLink "compilerfunctions" "compiler function" can be used to detect if a specific subsystem is used
  for the compilation.
