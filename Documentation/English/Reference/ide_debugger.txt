@Title Using the debugger


  PureBasic provides a powerful debugger that helps you find mistakes and bugs in your
  source code. It lets you control the program execution, watch your @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables",
  @ReferenceLink "dim" "arrays" or @ReferenceLink "newlist" "lists" or display 
  debug output of your programs. It also provides advanced 
  features for @ReferenceLink "inlinedasm" "assembly" programmer to examine and modify the CPU registers or view the 
  program stack, or the Memory of your program. It also provides the possibility to debug a program remotely 
  over the network.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  To enable the debugger for your program, you can select "Use Debugger" from the debugger
  menu, or set it in your programs Compiler options. By using the "Compile with Debugger"
  command from the Compiler menu, you can enable the debugger for just one compilation.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  You can directly use @ReferenceLink "debugger" "debugger commands" in your source, such
  as @Keyword CallDebugger, @Keyword Debug, @Keyword DebugLevel, @Keyword DisableDebugger and
  @Keyword EnableDebugger.

@LineBreak

  The PureBasic debugger comes in 3 forms:

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  A Debugger integrated directly with the IDE, for an easy to use, quick way to debug 
  your programs directly from the programming environment. This debugger also 
  provides the most features.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  A separate, standalone debugger, that is useful for some special purposes (for example, 
  when the same program must be executed and debugged several times at once) or to be used 
  with third party code Editors. It provides most of the features of the integrated IDE debugger,
  but because it is separate from the IDE, some of the efficiency of the direct access from the IDE is lost.
  The standalone debugger can be used to debug programs remotely through a network connection.


@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  A @LibraryLink "console" "console" only debugger. This debuggers primary use is for testing non-graphical 
  environment like on Linux systems without an X server, or to remotely develop through ssh. 

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The type of debugger that is used can be selected in the @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "preferences".

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  All this debugging functionality however comes at a price. Running a program in debug mode is 
  significantly slower in its execution that running it without the debugger. This should be no problem 
  however, since this is for testing only anyway.
@LineBreak
  If you need to use the debugger, but have some parts in you program that require the full execution 
  speed, you can disable the debugger in just that section with the @Keyword DisableDebugger / 
  @Keyword EnableDebugger keywords.


@Section The Debugger integrated into the IDE

@Image ide_debugger_integrated.png

  You can access all the debugger features while the program is running from the debugger menu, or the 
  corresponding toolbar buttons or shortcuts.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  While you are debugging your program, all the source files that belong to that program (also included files) 
  will be locked to read-only until the program has finished. This helps to ensure that the code 
  that is marked as the currently executed one is has not actually been modified already 
  without a recompilation.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Note that a program can be run only one time at once in IDE debugger mode. If you try to 
  executed it again, you are given the option to execute it with the standalone Debugger.



; == WINDOWS ONLY ==
@OS Windows

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Tip:"
@LineBreak
  The debugger menu is also added to the system-menu of the Main IDE window (the menu you 
  get when clicking the PB icon in the left/top of the window). This allows you to access 
  the debugger menu also from the Taskbar, by right-clicking on the Taskbar-Icon of the IDE.

@formatendif
; == END WINDOWS ONLY ==



@Section Program Control


  There are functions for basic control of the running program. You can halt 
  the execution to examine variables and the code position or let the code execute 
  line by line to follow the program flow. While the program is halted, the line that 
  is currently being executed is marked in your source code (with very light-blue 
  background color in the default colors).
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The state of the program can be viewed in the IDE status bar, and in the Error log area.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Menu commands for program control:

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold Stop
@LineBreak
  Halts the Program and displays the current line.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold Continue
@LineBreak
  Continues the program execution until another stop condition is met.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Kill Program"
@LineBreak
  This forces the program to end, and closes all associated debugger windows. 

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold Step
@LineBreak
  This executes one line of source code and then stops the execution again.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Step <n>"
@LineBreak
  This will execute a number of steps that you can specify and then stop the execution again.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Step Over"
@LineBreak
  This will execute the current line in the source and then stop again, just like the normal 'Step'.
  The difference is that if the current line contains calls to @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedures", the execution will not
  stop inside these procedures like it does with the normal 'Step', but it will execute the whole
  procedure and stop after it returned. This allows to quickly skip procedures in step mode.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Step Out"
@LineBreak
  This will execute the remaining code inside the current @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedure" and stop again after the procedure
  has returned. If the current line is not in any procedure, a normal 'Step' will be done.

@Section Line Breakpoints

  Breakpoints are another way to control the execution of your program. With the 
  Breakpoint menu command, you mark the currently selected line as a breakpoint 
  (or remove any breakpoint that exists in that line).
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  When the execution of the code reaches that line, it will stop at this point.
  Note that if you select a non-executable line (such as an empty line or a Structure definition), 
  it will halt the execution on the next executable line after that.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  After the execution of your program has stopped at a breakpoint, you can use any 
  of the Program control commands to continue/end the execution.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Breakpoints can be set and removed dynamically, while your program is running, 
  or while you are editing your source code. With the "Clear Breakpoints" command, you 
  can clear all breakpoints in a source file.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Note: You can also set/remove Breakpoints by holding down the Alt Key and clicking on
  the border that contains the Breakpoint marks.


@Section Data Breakpoints

@Image ide_debugger_databreak.png

  In addition to the line specific breakpoints, the debugger also provides data breakpoints.
  Data breakpoints halt the program if a given condition is met. This way it is easy to find 
  out when a variable or other value in the program changes and halt the program if that happens.
  The condition can be any @ReferenceLink "general_rules" "PureBasic expression" that can be evaluated to true or false. 
  This can be anything that could be put after an @Keyword "If" keyword, including @ReferenceLink "variables" "logical operators"
  such as @Keyword "And", @Keyword "Or" or @Keyword "Not". Most functions of the
  @LibraryLink "Math" "Math", @LibraryLink "Memory" "Memory" and @LibraryLink "String" "String"
  libraries as well as all object validation functions in the form IsXXX() and the XxxID functions
  for getting the OS identifiers for an object are also available.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Example conditions:
@Code
  MyVariable$ <> "Hello" Or Counter < 0  ; halt if MyVariable$ changes from "Hello" or if the Counter falls below zero
  PeekL(*SomeAddress+500) <> 0           ; halt if the long value at the given memory location is not equal to zero
@EndCode

  Data breakpoints can be added using the Data Breakpoint option from the Debugger menu.
  They can be limited to a specific @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedure" or they can be added for all code. The special
  "Main" entry of the procedure selection specifies that the data breakpoint should only
  be checked when the execution is not in any procedure.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The status column shows the status of all breakpoint conditions on their last evaluation. This
  can be true, false or an error if the condition is not a valid expression. Once a condition
  is evaluated to true, the program execution will be halted. This condition is automatically
  removed from the list as soon as the program continues, so that it does not halt the program
  again immediately.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Note: Checking for data breakpoints slows down the program execution because the breakpoint
  conditions have to be re-evaluated for every executed line of code to check if the condition is met.
  So data breakpoints should only be added when needed to keep the program execution fast otherwise.
  Limiting a data breakpoint to a certain procedure also increases the speed because the check then only
  affects the given procedure and not the entire program.


@Section Examining variables during runtime

  The value of a variable can be very quickly viewed while the program is running by placing the 
  mouse cursor over a variable in the source code and waiting for a brief moment. If the variable is 
  currently in scope and can be displayed, its value will be shown as a tool-tip on the mouse location.

  @Image ide_debugger_showstructure.png


  More complex @ReferenceLink "general_rules" "expressions" (for example @ReferenceLink "dim" "array" fields) 
  can be viewed by selecting them with the mouse and placing the mouse cursor over the selection.  

  @Image ide_debugger_showexpression.png


  The @ReferenceLink "ide_debugtools" "debugger tools" also offer a number of ways to examine the content
  of @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables", @ReferenceLink "dim" "arrays" or @LibraryLink "list" "lists".



@Section Errors in the Program

  If the debugger encounters an error in your program, it will halt the execution, 
  mark the line that contains the error (red background in the default colors) and 
  display the error-message in the error log and the status bar.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  At this point, you can still examine the variables of your program, the callstack 
  or the memory, however other features like the Register display or stack trace are 
  not available after an error.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  If the error is determined to be fatal (like an invalid memory access, or division 
  by 0), you are not allowed to continue the execution from this point. If the error 
  was reported by a PureBasic library, you are allowed to try to continue, but in many 
  cases, this may lead to further errors, as simply continuing just ignores the displayed error.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  After an error (even fatal ones), you have to use the "Kill Program" command to end 
  the program and continue editing the source code. The reason why the program is not
  automatically ended is that this would not allow to use the other debugger features 
  (like variable display) to find the cause of the error.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Note: you can configure the debugger to automatically kill the program on any error. 
  See @referencelink "ide_preferences" "Customizing the IDE" for that.

@Section Debugger warnings

  In some cases the debugger cannot be sure whether a given parameter is actually an error
  in the program or was specified like that on purpose. In such a case, the debugger issues a warning. 
  By default, a warning will be displayed with file and line number in the error log and the line will 
  be marked (orange in the default colors). This way the warnings do not go unnoticed, but they do 
  not interrupt the program flow.

; NOTE: This image shows a compiler warning, not a debugger warning!
;  @Image ide_debugger_warnings.png

  There is also the option of either ignoring all warnings or treating all warnings like errors 
  (stopping the program). The handling of debugger warnings can be customized globally in the 
  @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "Preferences" or for the current compiled program in the
  @ReferenceLink "ide_compiler" "Compiler options".

@Section The Error log

  The error log is used to keep track of the compiler errors, as well as the messages 
  from the debugging. Messages are always logged for the file they concern, so when an 
  error happens in an @ReferenceLink "includes" "included file", this file will be displayed, 
  and a message logged for it.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The "Error log" submenu of the Debugger menu provides functions for that:

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Show error log"
@LineBreak
  Shows / hides the log for the current source.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Clear log"
@LineBreak
  Clears the log for this file.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Copy log"
@LineBreak
  Copies the contents of the error log to the clipboard.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Clear Error marks"
@LineBreak
  After you have killed the program, any error mark in the source file will remain. 
  This is to help you identify the line that caused the problem and solve it. The 
  "Clear error Marks" command can be used to remove these marks.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  You can also configure the IDE to automatically clean the error marks when the 
  program ends. See @referencelink "ide_preferences" "Configuring the IDE" for that.




@Section The Standalone Debugger

@Image ide_debugger_extern.png

  The standalone debugger is very similar to the one in the IDE, and will be explained here only briefly:
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  On the Debugger window, you have control buttons to carry out the basic program control, 
  as described above. The "Step" button carries out as many steps as are set in the edit 
  field next to it. Closing the Debugger with "Quit" or the close button will also 
  kill the debugged program.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The Error log area can be hidden by the up arrow button on the right side in order 
  to make the debugger window smaller.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The code view is used to display the currently executed code line as well as any errors 
  or breakpoints. Use the combo box above it to select the included file to view. The "Set Breakpoint", 
  "Remove Breakpoint" and "Clear Breakpoints" can be used to manage breakpoints in the 
  currently displayed source file. The code view also provides the mouse-over feature from the integrated
  debugger to quickly view the content of a variable.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The debugger tools can be accessed from the buttons below the code area. Their usage is the same as with the 
  integrated IDE debugger. 

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Note: The Standalone Debugger has no configuration of its own. It will use the debugger settings and 
  coloring options from the IDE. So if you use a third-party Editor and the standalone debugger, you 
  should run the IDE at least once to customize the Debugger settings.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  @Bold "Executing the standalone debugger from the command-line:"
@LineBreak

  To execute a program compiled on the command-line with enabled debugger (-d or /DEBUGGER switch), 
  call the debugger like this:
@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  pbdebugger <executable file> <executable command-line>

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  If you execute a debugger-enabled executable from the command-line directly, it will only 
  use the command-line debugger.

@Section Remote debugging with the standalone debugger:

  The network debugging feature allows the easy debugging of programs on remote servers or inside
  of virtual machines while still using a comfortable graphical interface instead of the command-line
  debugger. The compilation of the program has to be handled separately either on the remote machine
  or on the local machine before transferring the file to the target machine.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The debuggers between all operating systems and processor types supported by PureBasic are compatible
  as long as the PureBasic version between the debugger and the compiler that compiled the program matches.
  This means that a program running on Linux x64 can be debugged using an x86 Windows machine without problems for example.
  The debugger and the compiled executable can both act as either the client or the server for the network
  connection depending on the command-line parameters. One instance of the debugger can be used to debug one
  program only. Multiple connections are not possible.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  @Bold "Running the debugger in network mode:"
@LineBreak
  The following command-line parameters control the network capabilities of the standalone debugger. 

@OS Windows
@FixedFont
  pbdebugger.exe /CONNECT=host[:port]  [/PASSWORD=password]
  pbdebugger.exe /LISTEN[=interface][:port]  [/PASSWORD=password]
@EndFixedFont
@ElseOS
@FixedFont
  pbdebugger --connect=host[:port]  [--password=password]
  pbdebugger --listen[=interface][:port]  [--password=password]
@EndFixedFont
@EndOS

  The "connect" mode connects the debugger as a client to an executable which must have been started as a server before.
  The "listen" mode creates a server and waits for an incoming connection from an executable. 
  If an the IP address of a local network interface is specified, the server will only listen on that specific interface. 
  Otherwise it will listen on all network interfaces for connections on the specified port.
  If no port is specified, the default port (port 10101) is used.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The password option enables encryption on the debugger data stream using AES. If the client is started without the
  password option but the server requires a password then you will be prompted to enter the password to establish a
  connection.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  @Bold "Running the executable in network mode:"
@LineBreak
  The executable has to be compiled in debugger mode as usual (using the /DEBUGGER or --debugger compiler switch). 
  It can then be started from the command-line with the following parameters to enable network mode. 
  The rules for client and server mode are the same as above.
  
@OS Windows
@FixedFont
  yourprogram.exe /DEBUGCONNECT=host[:port]  [/PASSWORD=password]
  yourprogram.exe /DEBUGLISTEN[=interface][:port]  [/PASSWORD=password]
@EndFixedFont
@ElseOS
@FixedFont
  ./yourprogram --debugconnect=host[:port]  [--password=password]
  ./yourprogram --debuglisten[=interface][:port]  [--password=password]
@EndFixedFont
@EndOS

  If command-line parameters cannot be used to start the program in network mode (for example because the 
  program also reads its command-line parameters and would be confused by the debugger related options) there is
  an alternative way by setting the following environment variable before executing the program (case sensitive):
@FixedFont
  PB_DEBUGGER_Communication=NetworkClient;host[:port][;password]
  PB_DEBUGGER_Communication=NetworkServer[;interface][:port][;password]
@EndFixedFont

  Once the network connection is established between debugger and executable, the debugging session works in the same way 
  as local debugging. If the debugger is closed, the debugged executable is terminated as well. It is not possible to
  disconnect or reconnect the debugger after the connection was established.

@Section The command-line debugger:

@Image ide_debugger_console.png

  The command-line debugger is not a part of the IDE and therefore not explained in detail here.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  While the program is running, hit Ctrl+C in the console to open a debugger console prompt.
  In this prompt type "help" to get an overview of all available commands.
  Type "help <commandname>" for a more detailed description of the command.


@Section Debugging threaded programs:
  
  To use the debugger with a program that creates @LibraryLink "thread" "threads", the 'Create thread-safe executable' Option must be set in the
  @ReferenceLink "ide_compiler" "Compiler options", as otherwise the information displayed by the debugger concerning
  line numbers, errors, local variables and such could be wrong due to the multiple threads.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The following features and limitations should be considered when debugging a threaded program:

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  While the program is running, the variable viewer, callstack display or assembly debugger will
  display information on the main thread only. When the program is stopped, they display information
  on the thread they were stopped in. So to examine local variables or the callstack of a thread,
  the execution must be halted within that thread (by putting a breakpoint or a @Keyword CallDebugger statement there).
  The various 'Step' options always apply to the thread where the execution was last stopped in.
@LineBreak
  If an error occurs, the execution is halted within that thread, so any information displayed by the
  variable viewer or callstack display is of the thread that caused the error.
@LineBreak
  The watchlist only watches local variables of the main thread, not those of any additional running threads.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  While the execution is stopped within one thread, the execution of all other threads is suspended as well.
