@Title Included debugging tools

  These tools provide many features to inspect your program while it is running. They can 
  not be used while you are editing the source code. These tools
  are available in both the integrated Debugger and the standalone debugger. The console 
  debugger provides many of these features too, but through a debugger console.

@LineBreak

  Some of the tools include the viewing of variables. 
  Here is an explanation of the common fields of all these variable displays:

@LineBreak

@Bold Scope
@LineBreak
  The scope of a variable is the area in which it is valid. It can be 
  @ReferenceLink "global" "global", @ReferenceLink "procedures" "local",
  @ReferenceLink "shared" "shared", @ReferenceLink "static" "static" or
  @ReferenceLink "threaded" "threaded",
  depending on how it is used in your source code. 'byref' ("by reference", i.e. using the address) is used to indicate
  an @ReferenceLink "dim" "Array" or @ReferenceLink "newlist" "List" that was passed
  as parameter to a procedure.

  A @ReferenceLink "structures" "Structure" is either marked as a dot, or with an arrow. 

@FormatEndIf
  
  If marked with an arrow, it can be expanded by double-clicking on it to view the members of this structure. 
  A down arrow marks an expanded structure. A Structure marked with a dot cannot be expanded 
  (usually because it is just a structure pointer).

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Dynamic arrays inside structures are shown with the dimensions they are currently allocated with. Lists and 
  maps inside structures are shown with their size and their current element (if any).


@Section The Debug output window

@Image ide_debugger_output.png

  In this window, the output of the @Keyword Debug statement will be displayed. The Debug 
  statement is a quick and simply way to print messages for debugging purposes.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The debug window will automatically open at the first output is produced by your 
  program. If you then close it, it will not automatically open on subsequent messages, 
  however they will still be logged. You can copy this output to the clipboard or 
  save it to a file. There is also a button to clear the messages from the window.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The entry field at the bottom of the window allows an expression to be entered, which
  will be evaluated and the result printed in the output box. This allows to quickly check
  the state of variables or array fields without the need to look them up in one of the
  debugger tools. The evaluation is started by pressing Enter or clicking on the "Display" button.
  If the expression cannot be evaluated for some reason, an error-message is displayed
  in the statusbar.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The expression can be any valid @ReferenceLink "general_rules" "PB expression" (not 
  including logical ones or containing @ReferenceLink "reference" "PB keywords").
  It can contain @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables", @ReferenceLink "dim" "arrays",
  @LibraryLink "List" "lists", @ReferenceLink "general_rules" "constants" and also some commands from the 
  @LibraryLink "Math" "Math", @LibraryLink "Memory" "Memory" and @LibraryLink "String" "String" libraries.


@Section The Watchlist

@Image ide_debugger_observer.png

  The watchlist can be used to track changes in @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables" of your program in real 
  time, while the program is running. It can only display single variables 
  (no full @ReferenceLink "structures" "structures"), however, these variables can be a part of structures.
  Elements of dynamic array, list or map inside structures can not be displayed in the watchlist.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  To add a variable, select its @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedure" (if it is a local variable) or 
  select "--- Main ---" if it is a @ReferenceLink "global" "global" variable or part of an 
  @ReferenceLink "dim" "array" or @ReferenceLink "newlist" "list".
  Then type the variable name, as you would access it in your source code into the Variable 
  field and press Add. 

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
@fixedfont
  Examples:
  MyVariable$                 - add a normal string variable
  Array(1, 5)                 - add an array field
  Structure\subfield[5]\value - add a variable inside a structure
  MyList()\structuresubfield  - add a variable inside a structured list
@endfixedfont

  You can also add new watched variables from the VariableViewer, by right-clicking 
  on them and selecting "add to watchlist"

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  In the list you will see the values of the watched variables. If the value is 
  displayed as "---", it means that this variable is not valid at the current point 
  in the source code; for example, this will occur if you watch a local variable, 
  or a list element and the list has no current element.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The watched variables are remembered between the debugging sessions, and even 
  saved with the compiler options, so you do not need to repopulate this list all the time.



@Section The Variable Viewer

@Image ide_debugger_variablelist.png

  The Variable viewer allows to examine the program's variables, @ReferenceLink "dim" "arrays",
  @ReferenceLink "newlist" "lists" and @ReferenceLink "newmap" "maps". The individual tabs
  show @ReferenceLink "global" "global" and @ReferenceLink "threaded" "threaded" items in the
  top part and @ReferenceLink "procedures" "local", @ReferenceLink "shared" "shared" and
  @ReferenceLink "static" "static" items in the bottom part.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  The "Update" Button can be used to get the most recent data from the program.
  If the program is halted or in step mode, the content is updated on each step
  automatically. By right-clicking on any variable or Array/List field, you can copy that variable, 
  or add it to the watchlist for real-time tracking of its value.

; === Windows only for the moment ===
@OS Windows
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  On Windows, the content of the Variable viewer can be sorted by name, scope or variable value by clicking on
  the header of the appropriate column.
@EndOS

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "The 'Variables' tab"
@LineBreak
  This tab, shows the variables of the program. 
  By right-clicking on a variable, it is possible to add it to the watchlist.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "The 'Arrays' tab"
@LineBreak
  This tab shows a list of all arrays in the program and the 
  dimensions in which they are currently defined (-1 means that @ReferenceLink "dim" "Dim" was not called yet).
  By right-clicking on an array, the content of the array can be viewed in the "View Array/List/Map" tab.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "The 'Lists' tab"
@LineBreak
  This tab shows a list of all Lists, the number of elements they 
  currently hold ( "-" indicates that @ReferenceLink "newlist" "NewList" was not called yet), as well as the 
  index of the current element of the list ( "-" indicates that there is no current element).
  By right-clicking on a list, the content of the list can be viewed in the "View Array/List/Map" tab.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "The 'Maps' tab"
@LineBreak
  This tab shows a list of all maps, the number of elements they 
  currently hold ( "-" indicates that @ReferenceLink "newmap" "NewMap" was not called yet), as well as the 
  key of the current element of the map ( "-" indicates that there is no current element).
  By right-clicking on a map, the content of the map can be viewed in the "View Array/List/Map" tab.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "The 'View Array/List/Map' tab"
@LineBreak
  This tab can be used to view individual entries of an array, a list or a map. This includes arrays, lists or maps
  inside structures as well.  
  To do so enter the name of the array, map or list including a "()" at the end, select what 
  kind of items to display and press "Display". Note that the content of the display is not automatically 
  updated when the program is in step mode.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  "Display all items" simply displays everything. "Display Non-zero items only" will only display those items that do not
  hold the value 0 or an empty string. This makes viewing large arrays/lists with only few valid items in them simpler.
  A @ReferenceLink "structures" "structure" is considered "zero" if all of its items either hold the value 0 or an empty string.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  "Display Range" allows displaying only a specific range of an array, a list or a map. The range can be given for each Array
  dimension individually, separated by commas. If one dimension is not specified at all, all of its items will be displayed.
  Here are a few examples for valid range input:

@FixedFont
  "1-2, 2-5, 2" : first index between 1 and 2, a second index between 2 and 5 and a third index of 2.
  "1, 2-5"      : first index of 1 and a second index between 2 and 5.
  "1, , 5"      : first index of 1, any second index and a third index of 5.
@EndFixedFont

  For list display, the "Display Range" option can be used to display a range of list elements by their index (zero based).

@FixedFont
  "0"     : first element
  "1-3"   : second to the fourth element
@EndFixedFont

  For map display, the "Display Range" option can be used to filter the keys to be displayed. It has to contain
  a mask for the key string of the map elements (no quotation marks). A "?" matches one character, a "*" matches 
  any number of characters. Here are a few examples for valid mask input:

@FixedFont
  "hat" : matches only the item with "hat" as key.
  "?at" : matches items with "hat", "bat" etc as key.
  "h*t" : matches items with keys that start with "h" and end with "t" and anything in between.
@EndFixedFont


@Section The Profiler

@Image ide_debugger_profiler.png

  The profiler tool can count how often each line in the source code is executed. This collected data
  can be used to identify which portions of the code are used most often and where improvements make
  most sense. It also helps to identify problems where a piece of the code is executed too often as 
  a result of an error.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Recording the data"
@LineBreak
  The recording of the data can be controlled by the Start, Stop and Reset (to set all counts to 0) buttons
  in the profiler window. The Update button can be used to update the graph while the program is running.
  Each time the program is halted or in step mode, the data is updated automatically. By default, the profiler
  is recording data from the start of the program. This can be changed in the @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "Preferences".
  
@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Examining the data"
@LineBreak
  The recorded data is displayed as a graph, with the vertical axis showing the source line number and
  the horizontal axis showing how often the lines were executed. If the running program consists of more
  than one source file, a list of source files is presented below the graph. To display the graph for
  a file either select it, or check its checkbox. Multiple files can be shown in the graph at once to better
  compare them. Right-clicking on one of the filenames allows changing the color used to display that file in the graph.
  
@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Mouse modes in the graph"
@LineBreak
  Right-clicking inside the graph brings up a popupmenu which allows zooming in or out or to show the source line
  that was clicked on in the IDE or code display of the debugger. The action taken by a left-click can be controlled
  by the buttons on the left side:

@Section The Callstack viewer

@Image ide_debugger_callstats.png

  The callstack viewer shows which nested @ReferenceLink "procedures" "procedure" calls led to the current position 
  in the code. Each entry in the list means one procedure that is currently open. It 
  shows the line and file from which it was called, and the arguments used to 
  call the procedure. By clicking on the Variables button for each procedure, you can 
  look at the @ReferenceLink "variables" "variables" of that instance of the procedure.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  This allows to easily trace, from which part of the code, a procedure was called.
  The callstack view does only automatically update when you stop the program, 
  or use Step to execute single lines. While the program is running, you have to use 
  the Update button to update the view for the current code position.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The "Statistics" tab shows the number of times each procedure in the code was called. 
  You can reset the count for all procedures with "Reset all", or for the currently marked 
  entry with the "Reset" button. Like with the callstack, the updates are not automatic 
  while the program is not stopped. Use the Update button for that.



@Section The Memory Viewer

@Image ide_debugger_memoryviewer.png

  The memory viewer lets you view a memory area in your program. 
  The range to view can be entered into the range fields as any valid PureBasic expression;
  this can be a normal decimal value, a hex number preceded by the ’$’ character or 
  any other valid expression, including variables or pointers from the code.
  If the content of the second range field starts with a "+" sign, the content is
  interpreted as relative to the first field.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Example: "*Buffer + 10" to "+30" will display the 30 bytes of memory starting
  at the location 10 bytes after what *Buffer points to.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  If the memory  area is valid for viewing, it will be displayed in the area below. 
  If parts of the area are not valid for reading, you will get an error-message.
  The type of display can be changed with the combo box in the lower left corner.
  The following view modes are available:

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Hex View"
@LineBreak
  The memory will be displayed like in any hex viewer, giving the memory location 
  in hex display on the left, followed by the hexadecimal byte values, and then 
  the string representation in the right column.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Byte/Character/Word/Long/Quad/Float/Double table"
@LineBreak
  The memory area will be shown as a table of the specified variable type. 
  Whether or not this table is single-column or multi-column can be set 
  in the Preferences (see @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "Configuring the IDE").
  Datas will be shown as decimal, octal or hex via the next button that cycles the mode. 

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "String view ascii, unicode or utf-8"
@LineBreak
  This displays the memory area as a string, with any non-string characters displayed 
  in [] (for example "[NULL]" for the 0 byte.) A linebreak is added after newline characters 
  and [NULL] to improve the readability of the output. The memory area can be interpreted as 
  an Ascii, Unicode or Utf8 string.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Data"
@LineBreak
 With the Data check box, you will export the table view formatted as a 
 @ReferenceLink "data" "Data Section" on copy or save.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  You can also export the viewed memory area from the memory viewer:

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Copy (Text)": Copies the displayed area as text to the clipboard.
@LineBreak
@Bold "Save (Text)": Saves the displayed area as text to a file.
@LineBreak
@Bold "Save (Raw)": Saves the memory area as raw binary to a file.
@LineBreak
 

@Section The Library Viewer

@Image ide_debugger_librarycalls.png

  The Library Viewer provides information about the objects created by some libraries. For example, it allows to
  quickly check which images are currently loaded in the program, or which gadgets are created.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Once the program is started, the combobox on top of the window can be used to select the library to view. The
  list below will then show all objects of the library that currently exist in the executable along with some
  additional information on each object. The "Update" button will update this list of objects. Selecting an object 
  in the list will display more detailed information about it in the text area on the left, and if supported by 
  the library also a visual display of the object on the right (for Images, Sprites, and so on).

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  
  If the combobox displays "No Information", this means that your executable has used no library that supports this feature.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Currently, the Library Viewer is supported by the following libraries:
@LineBreak
  @LibraryLink "Thread" "Thread"
@LineBreak
  @LibraryLink "Gadget" "Gadget"
@LineBreak
  @LibraryLink "Window" "Window"
@LineBreak
  @LibraryLink "File" "File"
@LineBreak
  @LibraryLink "Image" "Image"
@LineBreak
  @LibraryLink "Sprite" "Sprite"
@LineBreak
  @LibraryLink "Xml" "XML"
@LineBreak


@Section The Assembly Debugger

@Image ide_debugger_asm.png

  The ASM debugger is provided for advanced programmers to examine and change the CPU register
  content and to examine the programs stack for debugging of @ReferenceLink "inlinedasm" "inline ASM" code.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The Processor Register view is only available while the program execution is halted.
  By changing any of the register values and clicking "Set", you can modify the value in that register.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The Stack trace shows the content of the programs stack given in relation to the ESP 
  register. If the current stack position is not aligned at a 4 byte boundary, there can 
  be no information given about the content of the stack. In this case the stack is 
  shown as a hex display.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  If the stack pointer is properly aligned, the stack contents are displayed with comments 
  about the meaning of the contained values (detailing the pushed registers and other 
  values on a PureBasic procedure call).

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The stack trace is updated automatically when you stop the execution or step though the 
  program, unless you specify otherwise in the @ReferenceLink "ide_preferences" "Preferences". If you 
  disable the automatic update, there will be an "Update" button displayed to do so manually.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  Note: The Assembly debugger is currently not available on MacOS X.


@Section The Purifier

@Image ide_debugger_purifier.png

  The purifier can detect memory errors such as writing past the end of an allocated memory buffer or string.
  Without the purifier some of these mistakes would lead to crashes and others would go unnoticed because the
  write operation overwrites some other valid memory.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

  The purifier requires special output from the compiler to work, which is why it is only available if
  the "Enable Purifier" option is set in the @ReferenceLink "ide_compiler" "compiler options" when
  the program is compiled.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  
  The purifier detects these errors by placing a special 'salt'-value around global and local variables, 
  strings and allocated memory buffers. These salt values are then checked at regular intervals and an 
  error is displayed if they were changed. These checks slow down the program execution considerably especially
  for large programs, which is why the rate at which the checks are performed can be specified in the 
  purifier window:

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Global variable space"
@LineBreak
  Defines the interval in source lines after which the global variables are checked.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Local variable space"
@LineBreak
  Defines the interval in source lines after which the local variables are checked.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "String variables"
@LineBreak
  Defines the interval in source lines after which the memory used by string variables is checked.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak

@Bold "Allocated memory"
@LineBreak
  Defines the interval in source lines after which the memory allocated by 
  @@AllocateMemory is checked.
