@Library Library

@Overview

  Libraries are shared OS components which contain specific functions available to the programmer. For example,
  a library may contain functions designed to handle and manipulate pictures with ease. Each OS provides a number of
  shared libraries which help to ease the programmers life. With PureBasic, it is possible to access these external
  libraries not only easily, but also dynamically!

  The reason that libraries are so useful, is due to the fact that they are separate from the applications
  which use them, but at the same time shared between these applications. A library file requires only that
  it be loaded into memory once, this therefore saves memory, especially when it is a commonly used library.
  The programmer also benefits, since there is no need to keep re-inventing the wheel every time
  a clever feature is called for within an application.

  In addition, libraries are an excellent place to store procedures which are used by several programs.
  These libraries are easy to update, and when changes are made, there is no need to change the main
  executable which makes use of this library.

  On Linux shared libraries are known as: 'SO's, or System Objects.

@Function CloseLibrary(#Library)

@Description
  Closes a library previously opened using @@OpenLibrary, and frees any memory associated
  with this library.

@Parameter "#Library"
  The library to close. If @#PB_All is specified, all the remaining libraries are closed.

@NoReturnValue

@Function Result = CallCFunction(#Library, FunctionName$ [,Parameter1 [, Parameter2...]])

@Description

  Calls a function, in the specified library, in such a manner that the parameters are handled
  in the same fashion as a normal 'C' language function.

@Parameter "#Library"
  The library from which the function will be called.

@Parameter "FunctionName$"
  The name of the function to call. The function name is case sensitive.

@Parameter "Parameter1, Parameter2, ..."
  The parameters for the function. The number of parameters must match the parameters
  of the called function. The maximum number of supported parameters is 20. 

@ReturnValue
  Returns the return-value of the called function or zero if the library does not contain
  a function with the given name.

@Remarks
  If the function is described as 'cdecl' then this function must be used. However,
  most DLLs used within the Microsoft Windows OS do not use this form, so @@CallFunction
  should be sufficient in most cases.
  To call a function that uses the 'stdcall' calling convention, use the @@CallFunction function.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Note: This function is not very flexible and does not handle string/float/double/quad parameters or string/float/double/quad returns.
  The use of @ReferenceLink "prototypes" "prototypes" is now strongly recommended.

@Function Result = CallCFunctionFast(*FunctionPointer [,Parameter1 [, Parameter2...]])

@Description
  Calls a function directly, using its address. The function is expected to use the cdecl calling
  convention (the convention used by the C language).

@Parameter "*FunctionPointer"
  The address of the function to call.
@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  This pointer may be found using the
  @@GetFunction, @@GetFunctionEntry or @@LibraryFunctionAddress functions.
  The use of this function is the fastest method with which to call library functions, especially when
  the results of a call to: GetFunction() or LibraryFunctionAddress() have been stored. This is due to
  the fact that this function is not required to search for the name of the library function. 

@Parameter "Parameter1, Parameter2, ..."
  The parameters for the function. The number of parameters must match the parameters
  of the called function. The maximum number of supported parameters is 20. 

@ReturnValue
  Returns the return-value of the called function.

@Remarks
  If the function is described as 'cdecl' then the use of this function is required. However,
  most DLLs used within the Microsoft Windows OS do not use this form, so @@CallFunctionFast
  should be sufficient in most cases.
  To call a function that uses the 'stdcall' calling convention, use the @@CallFunctionFast function.

@LineBreak
@LineBreak
  Note: This function is not very flexible and does not handle string/float/double/quad parameters or string/float/double/quad returns.
  The use of @ReferenceLink "prototypes" "prototypes" is now strongly recommended.

@Example
@Code
  ProcedureC Function1()
      Debug "I call Function1 by its name"
  EndProcedure

  NewMap *FuncPtr()
  *FuncPtr("Function1") = @Function1()


  CallCFunctionFast(*FuncPtr("Function1"))

@Function Result = CountLibraryFunctions(#Library)

@Description
  Counts the number of functions available in a library. The library must be open when this function is called.

@Parameter "#Library"
  The number of the library which contains the functions to count. This number
  must be identical to that used previously with @@OpenLibrary.

@ReturnValue

@Function Result = ExamineLibraryFunctions(#Library)

@Description
  Initiates the process of examining the functions contained within a library. 

@Parameter "#Library"
  The number of the library which contains the functions to examine. This number
  must be identical to that used previously with: @@OpenLibrary.

@ReturnValue
  Returns nonzero if the functions can be examined and zero if not.

@Remarks
  If this function succeeds, the
  programmer may then step through the functions in the library by using @@NextLibraryFunction.
  At that point, information such as the name and address of each function may be obtained by using the
  @@LibraryFunctionName and @@LibraryFunctionAddress functions respectively.

  The number of the library which contains the functions to find. This number
  must be identical to that used previously with @@OpenLibrary.

@Parameter "FunctionName$"
  The name of the function from which to get the pointer.
  The function name is case sensitive.

@ReturnValue
  Returns the address to the function in the library on success and zero
  if the library does not contain a function with that name.

@Remarks
  The function can be called by its address using @ReferenceLink "prototypes" "prototypes". The functions

@Description

  Checks if the library, contains the given function entry. This searches for a library function by its position
  within the libraries function table, rather than by its name.

@Parameter "#Library"
  The number of the library which contains the functions to find. This number
  must be identical to that used previously with @@OpenLibrary.

@Parameter "FunctionEntry"
  A number representing the function index in the library. The first
  function is at index 1.

@ReturnValue
  Returns the address to the function in the library on success and zero
  if the library does not contain a function with that index.

@Remarks
  The function can be called by its address using @ReferenceLink "prototypes" "prototypes". The functions

@Parameter "#Library"
  The library value to test.

@ReturnValue

  This function is bulletproof and may be used with any value. 
  This is the correct way to ensure a
  library is ready for use.

@Function Result = LibraryFunctionAddress()

@Description

  Returns the address of the function in the library currently being examined with the
  @@ExamineLibraryFunctions and @@NextLibraryFunction functions.

@NoParameters

@ReturnValue
  Returns the address of the current function in memory. This is useful as parameter for the 
  functions @@CallFunctionFast or @@CallCFunctionFast.

@Remarks
  The function can be called by its address using @ReferenceLink "prototypes" "prototypes". The functions
  @@CallFunctionFast and @@CallCFunctionFast can also be used for that, but prototypes are the recommended method
  as they are more flexible.

  to be examined.

@Function Result = OpenLibrary(#Library, Filename$)

@Description
  Opens a shared library in order that the functions within it may be accessed. 

@Parameter "#Library"
  A number to identify this library. @ReferenceLink "purebasic_objects" "#PB_Any" can be used
  to auto-generate this number.

@Parameter "Filename$"
  The filename of the library to load. If the filename does not include a path, then the 
  operating system will search for the library in its system folders, the applications directory and
  the current directory. On Linux and MacOS, to load the library from the current directory, the
  './' path prefix needs to be specified.

@ReturnValue
  Returns nonzero if the library was opened successfully and zero if not.
  If @#PB_Any was used as the #Library parameter then the generated number for the
  library is returned on success.

@Remarks
  It's mandatory, that the created PureBasic executable and the shared library are using
  the same architecture (for example a x86 DLL can't be opened by x64 executables).
