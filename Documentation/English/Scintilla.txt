@Library Scintilla

@Overview
  Scintilla is a free source code editing component. It comes with complete source code and a
  license that permits use in any project or product personal or commercial. The license may be viewed
@MainGuideLink "license_scintilla" "here". The source code, as well as the library documentation may be found
  on the @InternetLink "http://www.scintilla.org/" "Scintilla Homepage".

@Bold "From the Scintilla Homepage: "
  As well as features found in standard text editing components, Scintilla includes features especially useful when editing
  and debugging source code. These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion and call tips.
  The selection margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line.
  Styling choices are more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple
  foreground and background colors and multiple fonts.

@Bold "Important:" The scintilla license requires that a copyright notice be included in all software that uses it
  and the license text itself be included in the documentation for the software.
  So if this library is used in software that is to be made public, the above linked license MUST be included with
  the software.

  PureBasic integrates the Scintilla library with the @LibraryLink "Gadget" "gadget library", so standard commands like
  @@ResizeGadget or @@HideGadget may be used with the scintilla
  control. Furthermore it provides the @@ScintillaSendMessage function to communicate
  with the control to use its full potential. All structures and constants needed are already defined in PureBasic.

  On Windows, the Scintilla.dll found in the "Compilers" folder of the PureBasic package needs to be shipped
  with your application. On OS X or Linux, the library is linked statically, so there is no extra shared object to include.

@SupportedOS


;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Function Result = InitScintilla([LibraryName$])

@Description
  Loads the Scintilla DLL which is needed to use the commands of this library.
  
@OptionalParameter "LibraryName$"
  Specifies the path and name of the DLL file (default is 'scintilla.dll').
  The scintilla DLL file is included in the "Compilers" folder of the PureBasic package.

@ReturnValue
  Nonzero if the library was loaded successfully, zero otherwise. On OS X and Linux, the return value is always
  @#True as the library is linked statically.

@Remarks
  This command is useful only on Windows, as on the other OS, the scintilla library is
  linked statically with the executable and therefore does not need to be loaded or distributed with the program.

@SupportedOS

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Function Result = ScintillaGadget(#Gadget, x, y, Width, Height, @Callback())

@Description
  Creates a new scintilla editing control in the current GadgetList.
  @@InitScintilla has to be called successfully before using this command. @Linebreak
  On Windows, the Scintilla.dll found in the "Compilers" folder of the PureBasic package needs to be shipped
  with your application. On OS X or Linux, the library is linked statically, so there is no extra shared object to include.

@Parameter "#Gadget"
  A number to identify the new gadget. @ReferenceLink "purebasic_objects" "#PB_Any" can
  be used to auto-generate this number.

@Parameter "x, y, Width, Height"
  The position and dimensions of the new gadget.

@Parameter "@Callback()"
  The address of a procedure to receive events from the control. It must be defined
  as follows, where 'Gadget' is the gadget number of the control and *scinotify points to a structure
  with information on the event:
@Code

  Procedure ScintillaCallBack(Gadget, *scinotify.SCNotification)
    ; You code here
  EndProcedure

@EndCode

@ReturnValue
  Nonzero on success, zero otherwise. If @#PB_Any was used as the #Gadget parameter
  then the return-value is the auto-generated gadget number on success.

@Remarks
  The following events are supported through @@EventType:
@FixedFont
  @#PB_EventType_RightClick
@EndFixedFont

  After creation, Scintilla specific commands may be sent to the control with the
  @@ScintillaSendMessage command. In addition common gadget commands like
  @@ResizeGadget or @@HideGadget may be used
  with the control as well.

@Example
@Code 
  If OpenWindow(0, 0, 0, 330, 90, "ScintillaGadget", #PB_Window_SystemMenu | #PB_Window_ScreenCentered)
    
    If InitScintilla()
      ScintillaGadget(0, 10, 10, 320, 70, 0)
      
      ; Output set to red color
      ScintillaSendMessage(0, #SCI_STYLESETFORE, 0, RGB(255, 0, 0))
      
      ; Set the initial text to the ScintillaGadget
      *Text=UTF8("This is a simple ScintillaGadget with text...")
      ScintillaSendMessage(0, #SCI_SETTEXT, 0, *Text)
      FreeMemory(*Text) ; The buffer made by UTF8() has to be freed, to avoid memory leak
      
      ; Adding a second line of text with linebreak before
      Text$ = Chr(10) + "Second line"
      *Text=UTF8(Text$)
      ScintillaSendMessage(0, #SCI_APPENDTEXT, Len(Text$), *Text)
      FreeMemory(*Text)
    EndIf
    
    Repeat : Until WaitWindowEvent() = #PB_Event_CloseWindow
  EndIf
@EndCode
